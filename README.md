## The Mission

*A sustainable future for our community, protecting lives, homes, and our environment*

Wildfire Resilience Through:
- Wildfire readiness to safely evacuate our human and animal residents and equip firefighters with access to water and safe staging areas,
- Home hardening and Zone 0 defense to reduce ember ignition risk, 
- Defensible space maintenance, protecting forest and riparian ecosystems.

## About Us

Our community formed in December 2024 after our four-person steering committee submitted a Community Risk Assessment and Three-year Action Plan to the National Fire Protection Agency. We could not have done it without the support of more than 30 households who responded to our initial outreach and without the support of our Firewise Coordinator, Lynn Sestak, with the Santa Cruz County Fire Safe Council. Read more about Firewise in Santa Cruz County at <a href="https://www.firesafesantacruz.org/firewise-usa-recognition-program">https://www.firesafesantacruz.org/firewise-usa-recognition-program

Our community has expanded since then to include 80 properties from the Mount Bache / Highland junction up to and including parts of Loma Prieta Way, shown in our [Interactive Community Map](https://winkleramy.github.io/MtBacheLoma/map.html)
