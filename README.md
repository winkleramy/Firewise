## About Us

We are an NFPA-recognized Firewise Community in Santa Cruz County, running along Mount Bache up to Loma Prieta Way. We include some Highland Way properties and all properties on Haven Hill, Mar Vista, and Rancho Prieta. 

Our community boundary includes 78 parcels and 76 dwellings, including vineyard and horse properties.

In 2024, we documented $120k in defensible space work, $80k in home hardening, and $1k in education and outreach. We have no doubt these numbers are actually much higher! And we are encouraging our neighbors to track their time and dollars spent towards wildfire resilience in 2025. See more on this topic on the [Participant Resources](#participant-resources) page.

Most updates are shared via an email with 33 households within our boundary and continue outreach through neighbor-to-neighbor private communication, in-person social events, and snail-mail.

## Insurance Discounts

The California FairPlan offers discounts for Firewise participation, home hardening, and defensible space.

To apply for the Firewise discount, download and share the following documents with your insurance broker:
- [Firewise Certificate 2025](Mt%20Bache%20Loma%20Prieta%20Plus%20%202024%20Certificate.pdf)
- [Community Map](Resources/Community%20Boundary.png)

If you are within our Firewise community boundary, then you automatically qualify for a Firewise participation discount with the California FairPlan in 2025.

To continue to qualify in future years, our Firewise community needs to document and share our wildfire education and risk reduction efforts with Firewise USA<sup>TM</sup> annually, typically around November. We need to show at least one hour of work or $31.80 spent multipled by the number of properties within our boundary. Please help us meet this requirement by documenting your wildfire preparation efforts! Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HqfeKdMY8orYj6p21nRU8xL4xSn_N-H0nxbRe3LQyBw/edit?usp=share_link) to see an example of how to document your activities. Participants are welcome to document activities on this sheet or track privately and share cumulative efforts - time/dollars spent plus estimated amount of brush removed - at the end of the year. Our steering committee will reach out in October to request this information for our annual renewal application.

To see if you might qualify for other discounts, visit the California Department of Insurance website [Safer from Wildfires](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/200-wrr/Safer-from-Wildfires.cfm)
