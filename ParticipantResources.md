# Mt Bache Loma Prieta Plus Firewise Participant Resources

[Return to Home Page](https://winkleramy.github.io/Firewise/)

As a Firewise community, we aim to support each other's wildfire resiliency efforts! Please remember to log your time and dollars spent on any efforts toward home hardening, defensible space, wildfire education, and evacuation planning. To remain in good standing, we need to report our community's cumulative time and dollars spent every November to the National Fire Protection Agency.

Residents can use our shared spreadsheet or can track privately and share with our steering committee in October for inclusion in our Firewise renewal application.

**To leave this page and go to the shared spreadsheet to log your Firewise activities, click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HqfeKdMY8orYj6p21nRU8xL4xSn_N-H0nxbRe3LQyBw/edit?usp=share_link0)**

Also, check out the Contractor Experiences tab for neighborhood contractor recommendations!

In 2025, we are specifically focusing on individual home hardening, emergency services access, evacuation planning, wildfire education, and outreach. Download the checklist below to see our recommended resident actions this year and share your feedback!

## Recognizing Fire Risks

When assessing your home's wildfire risk, consider these three categories of home ignition. Of these, 90% of homes are destroyed during a wildfire event due to ember ignition in Zone 0.

### Zone 0

For those new to Zone 0 home hardening practices or even for those veteran mountain residents who want to check-in on their progress, we recommend these free assessments:
- CALFIRE's home self-assessment and low-cost retrofit options at [https://www.fire.ca.gov/home-hardening](https://www.fire.ca.gov/home-hardening)
- Santa Cruz County Fire Safe Council Home Ignition Assessment, request at [https://www.firesafesantacruz.org/HIZ](https://www.firesafesantacruz.org/HIZ)

The state of California is planning to require some Zone 0 practices to be followed by law, with enforcement beginning around 2028. A public workshop was held in March 4, 2025 for feedback.

### Defensible space

For our community to thrive, we need to promote healthy forest and riparian ecosystems around us. We often repeat the phrase, "trees are not the problem, we are," as a way of reminding ourselves that our best path forward is to first focus on our home structure and Zone 0 and then work outwards, with the goal of supporting the natural environment. Indigenous people used fire to remove low-lying shrubs and non-fire resistant plants, creating magestic redwood forests over thousands of years. These forests were ideal for sheltering people walking under the canopy and for providing visibility for hunting. 

The recommendations from CALFIRE in Zone 2, 30-100' from the home, follow a similar model. We aim to reduce ladder fuels, which can carry fire from the ground into the canopy. This creates a sense of spaciousness under the tree canopy and greater visibility. We also aim to create shaded fuel breaks to slow the spread of invasive vegetation and reducing the heat produced during a wildfire event.

Forest management is its own specialty! We recommend the following resources to get started:

- Request a free on-site survey from the Resource Conservation District, for expert guidance on land management for both defensible space and maintaining a healthy ecosystem, [https://www.rcdsantacruz.org/request-services](https://www.rcdsantacruz.org/request-services)
- Consider native, fire-resistant plants recommended by the Resource Conservation District when landscaping, [Fire Scaping Native Plants PDF](Resources/2020updated%20FIRE%20SCAPING%20NATIVE%20PLANTS%20(Bay%20and%20Central%20Coast%20Area)%20pdf2.7.23.pdf)

### Wildfire and Evacuation Planning

During a wildfire event, we recommend evacuating when ordered to make room for firefighters to contain it. Many homeowneres stay behind to fight ember ignitions around their home rather than evacuate, putting themselves in life-threatening situations and possibly diverting resources for rescue operations. 

Firefighters are often deployed to the front line of an approaching fire, which can be miles from ember ignition events, so staying behind can feel like the only way to save your home. This is why focusing on home hardening and Zone 0 recommendations is so critical! These actions are designed to prevent ember ignition events near your home and buy time for firefighters to identify and respond to any new fires ignitied by embers in your neighborhood.

We want our firefighters to be as prepared as possible to save our communities. Please consider participating in our [Community Map Project](https://winkleramy.github.io/MtBacheLomaPrietaPlus/)! We need your help to identify water sources, emergency vehicle turnarounds, and staging areas in our community. We update this information with CALFIRE as we receive it.

Please be familiar with the evacuation information resources below:

- Our community includes properties in evacuation zones CRZ-E039 and CRZ-E042. Confirm your [evacuation zone](https://community.zonehaven.com/?latlon=36.96424815874178,-121.89650172251152&z=11.258739892981657) and sign up for emergency notifications on [CruzAware](https://www.santacruzcountyca.gov/OR3/Response/PlanandPrepare/AlertNotificationApplication.aspx)
- Review evacuation information at the Santa Cruz County Office of Response, Recovery, and Resilience (OR3) [website](https://www.santacruzcountyca.gov/OR3/Response/Evacuations.aspx)
