# Mount Bache Neighborhood Firewise Community

Hello neighbors! We are working to form a Firewise community in our neighborhood.

## Why Join Firewise?

As we all know, living in the Santa Cruz Mountains is a privilege but also a great challenge. Our forest ecosystem has undergone major changes in the last 150 years and needs our stewardship to thrive. We have learned from recent wildfire activity that we need to do more. The Fire Safe Council of Santa Cruz formed in 2016 to educate and mobilize local residents to protect their lives, homes, communities, and environment from wildfire. Their top recommendation is to participate in Firewise! Firewise communities are self-organized neighborhoods that band together to collaborate and share resources to build community resilience to shared challenges and support the beautiful forest and riparian ecosystem that we all love so much.
