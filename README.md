# Mount Bache Neighborhood Firewise Community

Hello neighbors! We are working to form a Firewise community in our neighborhood and we need your help.

## Why Join Firewise?

As we all know, living in the Santa Cruz Mountains is a privilege but also a great challenge. Our forest ecosystem has undergone major changes in the last 150 years and needs our stewardship to thrive. We have learned from recent wildfire activity that we need to do more. The Fire Safe Council of Santa Cruz formed in 2016 to educate and mobilize local residents to protect their lives, homes, communities, and environment from wildfire. Their top recommendation is to participate in Firewise! Firewise communities are self-organized neighborhoods that band together to collaborate and share resources to build community resilience to shared challenges and support the beautiful forest and riparian ecosystem that we all love so much. 

## How to Join Firewise

1. Form a steering committee of 2-5 neighbors. Determine a continuous community boundary of at least eight households willing to participate in Firewise
2. Perform community risk assessment with a local fire professional
3. Host or attend an educational event once per year
4. Develop a three-year plan, informed by community risk assessment
5. Document community's annual efforts, e.g. cleaning gutters, yard work, any home hardening improvements. Show at least one hour or $30 spent per year per household for these activities.
6. Create an online account. Submit documentation from previous steps. Renew every three years.

So what progress have we made so far and what do we have left to do?

### Step 1: Form a steering committee and determine a community boundary

We have two people willing to participate in our steering committee, which is the minimum required. We would like three more people to help speak for various subgroups in our neighborhood and help us determine where to draw our continuous community boundary.

Steering Committee
1. Amy Winkler, Mount Bache
2. Merry Fay, Rancho Prieta
3. ? Mar Vista
4. ? Loma Prieta Way
5. ? Haven Hill

### Step 2: Perform community risk assessment with a local fire professional

A community risk assessment needs to be performed initially to apply for Firewise and then once every five years to remain in good standing. The steering committee is responsible for completing the community risk assessment document with input from all participating residents. Every participant can help by answering the community risk assessment questions for their own property. This data submitted to Firewise is aggregated, no individual property is called out, effectively anonymizing the information.

### Step 3: Host or attend an educational event once per year

This year, our community event is a zoom call with Lynn Sestak, volunteering as the Firewise Coordinator for Santa Cruz County, to share information and answer questions about Firewise. This event takes place Thursday, August 8, at 6pm. A recording of the event will be shared afterwards.

In order to share information about this event and future events, our steering committee needs to know how to best contact the Firewise participants in our community. Please share your name, mailing address, email address, and/or phone number with our steering committee by emailing Amy at winkleramy@gmail.com

### Step 4: Develop a three-year plan

This plan is informed by the community risk assessment as well as shared concerns by Firewise participants. Please let our steering committee know what issues you would like our Firewise community to focus on:

- Home Hardening *Embers are the #1 cause of home ignition during wildfire! Hardening the home and Zone 0 yard against embers is the most cost effective*
- Fuel Reduction & Defensible Space *Direct flames and radiant heat are the two additional paths to home ignition. Keep fire as far away and as low intensity as possible. Defensible Space is required by law and increases the odds that firefighters will be willing to “make a stand” for our homes*
- Wildfire Preparedness & Evacuation Planning *Prepare our neighborhood to quickly and safely evacuate if need be. Make it easy for first responder vehicles to drive in. Some communities have phone chains or a WhatsApp group to share evacuation information and check on neighbors.*
- Education & Outreach *Learn and share how to manage our forest and riparian areas to promote a healthy and resilient ecosystem. Learn about and share county resources and information on home hardening and defensible space.*

### Step 5: Document community's annual efforts

Let our steering committee know how much time and/or money you have spent on home hardening, defensible space, wildfire preparedness, and/or education activities. Our steering committee will reach out annually via your preferred contact method. We will need to show at least one hour or $30 spent per household per year to remain in good standing.

### Step 6: Create an online account

Once we complete steps 1-5, our steering committee will apply and share any feedback from the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) on our application to be a recognized Firewise Community.

### Step 7: Reap the benefits!

Enjoy of a greater sense of community and resilience to whatever challenges come our way! Ask your insurance provider about discounts for being part of a NFPA-recognized Firewise Community.
