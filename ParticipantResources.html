<p>When assessing your home's wildfire risk, consider these three categories of home ignition. Of these, 90% of homes are destroyed during a wildfire event due to ember ignition in Zone 0.</p>

<p>For those new to Zone 0 home hardening practices or even for those veteran mountain residents who want to check-in on their progress, we recommend these free assessments:
- CALFIRE's home self-assessment and low-cost retrofit options at <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/home-hardening">https://www.fire.ca.gov/home-hardening</a>
- Santa Cruz County Fire Safe Council Home Ignition Assessment, request at <a href="https://www.firesafesantacruz.org/HIZ">https://www.firesafesantacruz.org/HIZ</a></p>
<p>The state of California is planning to require some Zone 0 practices to be followed by law, with enforcement beginning around 2028. A public workshop was held in March 4, 2025 for feedback. </p>
<h2>Zone 0 Recommendations by the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection</h2>
