# Mount Bache Neighborhood Firewise Community

Hello neighbors! We are working to form a Firewise community in our neighborhood and we need your help.

## Why Join Firewise?

As we all know, living in the Santa Cruz Mountains is a privilege but also a great challenge. Our forest ecosystem has undergone major changes in the last 150 years and needs our stewardship to thrive. We have learned from recent wildfire activity that we need to do more. The Fire Safe Council of Santa Cruz formed in 2016 to educate and mobilize local residents to protect their lives, homes, communities, and environment from wildfire. Their top recommendation is to participate in Firewise! Firewise communities are self-organized neighborhoods that band together to collaborate and share resources to build community resilience to shared challenges and support the beautiful forest and riparian ecosystem that we all love so much. 

## How to Join Firewise

1. Form a steering committee of 2-5 neighbors. Determine a continuous community boundary of at least eight households willing to participate in Firewise
2. Perform community risk assessment with a local fire professional
3. Host or attend an educational event once per year
4. Develop a three-year plan, informed by community risk assessment
5. Document community's annual efforts, e.g. cleaning gutters, yard work, any home hardening improvements. Show at least one hour or $30 spent per year per household for these activities.
6. Create an online account. Submit documentation from previous steps. Renew every three years.

So what progress have we made so far?

### Step 1: Form a steering committee and determine a community boundary

We have two people willing to participate in our steering committee, which is the minimum required. We would like three more people, especially from natural sub-groups of our neighborhood.
